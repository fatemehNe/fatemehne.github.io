Our team built and presented a rapid response plan for a simulated breach. I co-led the investigation narrative, coordinated containment steps, and delivered the final briefing to judges.

Highlights:

- The presentation was tailored to be delivered to business management and thus focused on business impact rather than technical point.
- Structured incident timeline, decision points, and regulator-ready reporting.
- Clear containment and remediation plan with short- and long-term actions.
- Lessons on team coordination and communicating technical risks to executives.
