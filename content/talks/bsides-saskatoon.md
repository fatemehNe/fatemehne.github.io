In my Saskatoon BSides presentation on Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), I focused on the **strategic side of CTI** and the essential role it plays in vulnerability management, risk management, business decision-making, and long-term organizational strategy. Instead of revisiting the familiar operational use cases, I showed how intelligence should drive rational, informed decisions that truly support and protect the business.

Core themes:
- Responsible growth: CTI insights help leaders decide where to invest, how to prioritize, and how to build teams aligned to the threats that matter most.
- Missed potential: many programs fixate on indicators and technical outputs, overlooking where CTI can shape planning, resource allocation, and overall posture.
- Strategic impact: CTI should influence business and security decisions, not just feed detections—treat it as a foundational asset for both risk and growth.

Goal: encourage practitioners and leaders to think beyond the basics and recognize CTI’s full potential as a strategic asset that supports the entire business.
