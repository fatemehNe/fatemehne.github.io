I love sharing security learnings with the community. Here you can find the talks, workshops, and panels I have delivered, along with slides or recordings when available.

Each card below links to the full details for that talk.

Recent sessions include BSides Saskatoon on threat intelligence, the winning ELCH/SiberX incident response presentation, and research presented at ARES 2022.
